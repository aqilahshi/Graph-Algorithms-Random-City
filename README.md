# Graph-Algorithms-Random-City
This is assignment with people in group. Each of us assigned with one function.

Function 1: Check if the graph is strongly connected. If it is not, generate random edges* between random cities until the graph is strongly connected. Print the resulting graph.
Function 2: Check if the graph has a cycle. If it is not, generate random edges* between random cities until the graph has a cycle. Print the resulting cycle.
Function 3: Allow the user to select two vertices and compute the shortest path between the vertices. If there is no path between the selected vertices, generate random edges* between random cities until the path exists. Print the shortest path.
Include an additional function to RESET the graph to default.
Include an additional function for the user to REMOVE EDGES of their choice.
